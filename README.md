**Project Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer behavior in a direct phone call marketing campaign conducted by a Portuguese bank from May 2008 to November 2010. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit based on various customer and campaign attributes.

**Dataset**
The dataset contains information on phone call marketing campaigns aimed at promoting term deposits. The dataset is stored in the file bank-additional-full.csv, which contains a variety of customer-related and campaign-related attributes.

Domain: Finance/Banking
Data Source: Portuguese Bank Dataset
Features
The dataset includes 21 features, such as:

Personal Attributes: Age, job, marital status, education level, credit default, housing loan, personal loan, etc.
Campaign Details: Contact type, number of contacts during the campaign, month, day of the week, previous campaign outcome, etc.
Social and Economic Indicators: Employment variation rate, consumer price index, consumer confidence index, euribor rate, number of employees, etc.
Target Variable: Whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (binary: yes or no).
Objectives
Perform detailed data analysis to understand customer characteristics and their behavior in the marketing campaign.
Build multiple machine learning models and compare their performance in predicting customer subscription to the term deposit.
Provide recommendations to the marketing team to improve the campaignâ€™s effectiveness.
Key Deliverables
Data Analysis Report: Detailed insights into the customer demographics, campaign success rates, and significant factors influencing term deposit subscriptions.
Model Comparison Report: A performance comparison of various machine learning models and the selection of the best model for production.
Challenges Report: Documentation of challenges faced during the project, including data cleaning, model building, and performance evaluation.
